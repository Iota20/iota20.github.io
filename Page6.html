      <h1>Computer Software</h1>
      <hr><br>
      <div class="par1">
        <p>Software is a set of instructions, data or programs used to
          operate computers and execute specific tasks.
          Software is a generic term used to refer to applications,
          scripts and programs that run on a device.
          It can be thought of as the variable part of a computer,
          while hardware is the invariable part.
          All software provides the directions and data computers
          need to work and meet users' needs.
        </p>
      </div>
      <br><br>
      <div class="softwareTypes">
        <h2>Types of Software</h2>
        <br>
        <h3>1. Application Software</h3>
        <br>
        <p>Application software consists of many programs that
          perform specific functions for end users, such as
          writing reports and navigating websites.
          Applications also perform tasks for other applications.
          Applications on a computer can't run on their own;
          they require a computer's OS along with other
          supporting system software programs to work.
          Applications are installed on a user's computer and
          use the computer memory to carry out tasks. Desktop
          applications must adhere to the requirements of the
          hardware devices they run on. They take up space on
          the computer's hard drive and don't need an internet
          connection to work. Webpages on the other hand
          require internet access.</p>
        <br>
        <h4>General Purpose Application Software</h4>
        <br>
        <p>A general purpose application, sometimes known as 'off-the-shelf' 
          is the sort of software that you use at home and
          school. Examples include word processors, spreadsheets,
          databases, desktop publishing packages, graphics
          packages etc.
          General-purpose software performs a large range of
          specific basic tasks. They fulfill all the general tasks that a
          person needs to perform on the system. There are
          numerous applications that a user needs to perform.</p>
        <br>
        <h4>Application Specific Software</h4>
        <br>
        <p>Application-specific software packages are
          customized to meet the needs of particular
          applications. Sometimes people give the order to
          create certain special software according to their
          own specific requirements. Programmers generally
          develop such software on special demands. This
          software excludes the extra features of application
          software. Therefore, only such features are present
          which the user actually requires for his purpose.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h3>2. System Software</h3>
        <br>
        <p>System software sits between the computer hardware
          and the application software. Users don't interact
          directly with system software as it runs in the
          background, handling the basic functions of the
          computer.
          This software coordinates a system's hardware and
          software so users can run high-level application
          software to perform specific actions. System software
          executes when a computer system boots up and
          continues running as long as the system is on.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h4>System Management Software</h4>
        <br>
        <p>These are software that run, manage, and/or support
          computer hardware, networking, application software
          execution, and data resources. Examples include
          operating systems, network management programs,
          DBMS, and system utilities.
          Systems Management software does not limit to single
          computer but also to the enterprise-wide administration
          of IT systems. It can include a wide array of tasks
          spanning across different operating systems, applications
          and infrastructure.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h4>Device Drivers</h4>
        <br>
        <p>A driver, or device driver, is a set of files that tells a piece
          of hardware how to function by communicating with a
          computer's operating system. All pieces of hardware
          require a driver, from your internal computer
          components, such as your graphics card, to your external
          peripherals, like a printer.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h4>System Development Software</h4>
        <br>
        <p>Systems development is the process of defining,
          designing, testing and implementing a new software
          application or program. It can include the internal
          development of customized systems, the creation of
          database systems or the acquisition of third party
          developed software. Systems Developers uses tools or
          computer program that use to create, debug, maintain, or
          otherwise support other programs and applications. The
          use of Integrated Development Environment software to
          code in a programming language is an example.
          A programming language is a system of notation for
          writing computer programs. Programming languages are
          described in terms of their syntax and semantics, usually
          defined by a formal language. Programming languages
          are classified into generations and types.

        <h1>Data, Information, and Information Systems</h1>
        <hr><br><br>
        <h3>Data</h3>
        <br>
        <p>Data are raw facts, events, numbers and transactions,
          which have been collected, recorded, stored but are not
          yet processed.
          Data is an individual unit that contains raw materials
          which do not carry any specific meaning.
          Data doesn't depend on information.
          Raw data alone is insufficient for decision making. 
          Observation and recording are done to produce data.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h3>Information</h3>
        <br>
        <p>Information is processed data.
          Processing could be in the form of addition, subtracting,
          comparison, sorting, rearrangement etc.
          Information could be defined as the desired form to which data
          is finally transformed after undergoing a series of processing.
          Information is sufficient for decision making as it
          depends on data.
          It is obtained after subjecting data to a series of processing
          operations which convert related groups of data (raw facts) into
          a meaningful and coherent form.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>There are two types of information: quantitative and qualitative information.
          Quantitative information deals with the magnitudes of
          variables, their variability or absolute values. This data is any
          quantifiable information that researchers can use for
          mathematical calculations and statistical analysis to make real-life decisions based on 
          these mathematical derivations. Qualitative information is related to the attributes 
          of an entity in respect of quality factors. This type of information is not exact
          (precise) in nature but it is very useful for comparative measurement. 
        </p>
        <br>
        <h3>Information Systems</h3>
        <br>
        <p>Information systems (IS) involve a variety of information technologies (IT)
          such as computers, software, databases, communication systems, the
          Internet, mobile devices and much more, to perform specific tasks, interact
          with and inform various actors in different organizational or social contexts.
          It is the set of interconnected procedures, the purpose of which is to
          provide managers at all levels and in all functions of an organization with
          the information necessary to enable them make timely and effective
          decisions. It is a combination or collection of people, hardware, software,
          communication networks and data resources that collects, transform and
          provides information to managers at all levels in all functions to allow timely
          and effective decision making in an organization.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h3>Types of Information Systems</h3>
        <br>
        <h4>Knowledge Work Systems (KWS)</h4>
        <br>
        <p>The Knowledge Work System is a specialized
          system that expedites knowledge creation
          and ensures the business's technical skills
          and knowledge are correctly applied. The
          Knowledge Work System aids workers in
          creating and disseminating new information
          using graphics, communication, and
          document management tools.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h4>Management Information Systems (MIS)</h4>
        <br>
        <p>Management Information Systems are
          designed to help middle managers and
          supervisors make decisions, plan, and
          control the workflow. The MIS pulls
          transactional data from various
          Transactional Processing Systems, compiles
          the information, and presents it in reports
          and displays.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h4>Decision Support Systems (DSS)</h4>
        <br>
        <p>The DSS is a management-level, interactive,
          computer-based information system that
          helps managers make decisions. A decision
          support system analyses business data and
          other information related to the enterprise
          to offer automation in decision-making or
          problem-solving.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h4>Transaction Processing Systems (TPS)</h4>
        <br>
        <p>The transaction processing system
          automates the transaction collection,
          modification, and retrieval process. The
          peculiar characteristic of this type of
          information system is that it increases the
          performance, reliability, and consistency of
          business transactions. Transaction
          processing is essential to helping businesses
          perform daily operations.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h4>Office Automation Systems (OAS)</h4>
        <br>
        <p>Office Automation Systems comprises
          computers, communication-related
          technology, and personnel assigned to
          perform official tasks. It automates different
          administrative processes like documenting,
          recording data, and office transactions,
          among others.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h4>Executive Support Systems (ESS)</h4>
        <br>
        <p>An Executive Support System or ESS helps top-level 
          executives to plan and control workflow
          and make business decisions. It is very similar to
          Management Information System or MIS. The
          ESS provides greater telecommunication, better
          computing capabilities, and more efficient
          display options than the DSS. Executives use ESS
          to make effective decisions based on
          summarized internal data taken from DSS, MIS,
          and external sources.
