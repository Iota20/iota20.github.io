      <div class="par1">
        <p>Computer hardware is a collective term used to describe
          any of the physical components of an analog or digital
          computer. Computer hardware can be categorized as
          being either internal or external components. Generally,
          internal hardware components are those necessary for the
          proper functioning of the computer, while external
          hardware components are attached to the computer to
          add or enhance functionality.

        <h2>External Hardware</h2>
        <br>
        <p>External hardware refers to physical devices that are connected 
          to a computer from the outside to enhance its functionality or enable 
          specific tasks. These peripherals are not built into the main computer 
          system but interact with it via wired or wireless connections. Common 
          examples of external hardware include input devices like keyboards and 
          mice, output devices like monitors and printers, and storage devices 
          like external hard drives and USB flash drives. More specialized peripherals, 
          such as scanners, webcams, and external GPUs, expand the computer's 
          capabilities further. Networking hardware, including routers and modems, 
          facilitates internet and network access. These devices are essential for 
          creating a versatile and user-friendly computing environment, allowing 
          users to customize their systems based on their needs. By enabling 
          adaptability and increased performance, external hardware plays a critical 
          role in computing, whether for personal, professional, or industrial applications.
          Below are some examples of external hardware you can connect to computers.

        <h2>Internal Hardware</h2>
        <br>
        <p>Internal hardware comprises the essential components housed within a computer's 
          casing, responsible for executing its core functions and ensuring seamless operation. 
          These components work together to process data, execute instructions, and store 
          information. The central processing unit (CPU), often referred to as the computer's 
          brain, performs calculations and logical operations. The motherboard acts as the central 
          hub, connecting all internal components, including the CPU, random access memory (RAM), 
          and storage devices like solid-state drives (SSD) or hard disk drives (HDD). RAM provides 
          temporary storage for active processes, enabling quick access to data, while storage drives 
          offer long-term data retention. Graphics processing units (GPU) handle rendering and 
          graphical tasks, essential for gaming, video editing, and 3D modeling. Power is supplied by 
          the power supply unit (PSU), which converts electricity into usable forms for each component. 
          Cooling systems, such as fans or liquid cooling, maintain optimal operating temperatures. 
          Together, these internal hardware components form the backbone of a computer, dictating its 
          speed, efficiency, and capabilities.

        <h1>Motherboards</h1>
        <hr><br>
        <p>A motherboard is the main printed circuit board in a computer system. The motherboard
          is a computer's central communications backbone connectivity point, through which all
          components and external peripherals connect. Motherboards are found in every computer.
          They contain and connect the essential components that are required for a computer to
          function. Motherboards manage data flow, optimize power distribution, and enhance computer
          performance.
        </p>
        <br><br>
        <p>There are different types and specifications of motherboards. Components and
          functionalities within computers stay relatively consistent. But, size and component
          accommodation can vary based on available space. One example of this is how desktop
          components are socketed, which makes it easy for replacement, but laptop or smartphone
          components are soldered, which can make replacement challenging.
          Manufacturers developed different specifications or form factors for motherboards to
          suit different computer designs, categorized based on capabilities, features, and the physical
          size and shape.
        </p>
        <br><br>
        <h3>Types of Motherboards</h3>
        <br>
        <h4>1. AT Motherboard</h4>
        <p>This motherboard was popular in the 1980's. AT stands for Advanced Technical.
          These motherboards were a specific size and shape, fitting only in AT computer cases.
          On an AT motherboard, you'd find a big power connector and several slots for extra parts
          along the bottom edge. The processor is connected in the top right corner. Memory slots
          were next to the processor. The power connections on these motherboards are in the
          form of sockets and plugs with six prongs each. Due to the difficulty in recognizing these
          power connections, users often have issues while trying to connect and operate them.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h4>2. ATX Motherboard</h4>
        <p>The ATX motherboards are the newer type of motherboard used in most modern
          computers. It is an enhanced version of the AT motherboard created by Intel in the
          1990’s. ATX stands for “Advanced Technology Extended”. These motherboards are the
          improved version of the older AT motherboards. The power connector is at the top of the
          board. Slots for the extra parts are along the bottom. The slots are bigger and give more
          room between the parts. The processor fits in the middle with the memory slots to its
          right. One big improvement in ATX motherboards is better power management. A new
          power system was added that lets you turn the computer on and off through the
          operating system.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h4>3. Extended ATX Motherboard</h4>
        <p>This motherboard supports a single or a twin CPU configuration and has up to
          eight RAM slots. Additionally, it has a higher number of PCIe and PCI slots, which may
          be used to add PCI cards for a wide range of applications. Workstations and servers are
          both able to use this software. There is sufficient room on all eATX motherboards,
          making them ideal for desktop computers, thanks to the significant space provided for
          airflow and the attachment of various components.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h4>4. BTX Motherboard</h4>
        <p>BTX stands for Balanced Technology Extended. This motherboard was intended
          to manage the demands of new technologies in terms of more power requirements.
          Hence, this motherboard generates more heat.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h4>5. LPX Motherboard</h4>
        <p>LPX stands for Low-Profile Extended. Compared to previous motherboards, this
          form has two significant enhancements. First is that the input and output ports were
          moved to the rear of the device. And the second is the addition of a riser card which
          allows for the device to have additional slots and makes it easier to attach components.
          Some of these features were implemented to the AT motherboard. The disadvantage of
          this motherboard is the lack of an accelerated graphics port, which results in a direct
          connection to PCI. Newer boards called the NLX (New Low Profile Extended) addresses
          issues in this motherboard.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h4>6. Micro ATX Motherboard</h4>
        <p>This motherboard has fewer ports and slots than the Standard ATX board. This
          motherboard is made for users that don't want excessive connections or upgrades to
          their computers. This motherboard can be installed in any case that can accommodate
          its size.
        </p>
