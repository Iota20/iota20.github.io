        <h1>Computing Disciplines</h1>
        <hr><br>
        <p>The field of computing offers a diverse array of disciplines, each with unique 
          focuses, skill sets, and career paths. Computer Science delves into algorithms, 
          programming, and the theoretical foundations of computation. Information Technology 
          emphasizes managing and maintaining computer systems and networks. Information 
          Systems bridges the gap between business needs and technology, focusing on using IT 
          to improve organizational processes. Computer Engineering combines hardware and software 
          design, developing the physical systems that power modern devices. Software Engineering 
          specializes in designing, developing, and maintaining software applications systematically 
          and efficiently. Together, these disciplines offer a wealth of opportunities for aspiring 
          professionals, from roles in artificial intelligence and cybersecurity to system architecture 
          and software development, shaping the future of innovation and technology.

        <h2>Computer Science</h2>
        <br>
        <p>Computer Science is the study of computers and computational systems, encompassing a wide 
          range of topics, from algorithms and data structures to computer architecture, network 
          design, and artificial intelligence. It focuses on the development, testing, and optimization 
          of software and systems, using mathematical algorithms, programming techniques, and coding 
          methodologies. This discipline covers everything from designing algorithms that drive modern 
          software to understanding how software interacts with hardware and processes data. Computer 
          Science also delves into fields like machine learning, human-computer interaction, cybersecurity, 
          and cloud computing, offering solutions to complex problems and driving technological innovation. 
          Its applications span industries such as healthcare, finance, entertainment, and education, making 
          it a cornerstone of modern advancements in technology and society.

        <h2>Computer Engineering</h2>
        <br>
        <p>Computer engineering is defined as the discipline that embodies the science and technology of 
          design, construction, implementation, and maintenance of software and hardware components of 
          modern computing systems and computer-controlled equipment. Computer engineering has traditionally 
          been viewed as a combination of both computer science (CS) and electrical engineering (EE). It has 
          evolved over the past three decades as a separate, although intimately related, discipline. Computer 
          engineering is solidly grounded in the theories and principles of computing, mathematics, science, 
          and engineering and it applies these theories and principles to solve technical problems through the 
          design of computing hardware, software, networks, and processes. Computer engineering bridges the 
          divide between hardware and software. While computer scientists tend to focus on the theory of 
          computer systems, including software and programming, computer engineers understand computer systems 
          in their entirety.

        <h2>Information Technology</h2>
        <br>
        <p>Information Technology is the use of computer systems to access and manage information. IT involves 
          the use of technology to communicate, transfer data and process information. It is associated with 
          computer systems related to the processing and distribution of data. IT can be also be defined as 
          technology that applies processing techniques, applies statistical and mathematical methods for 
          decision making, and or the simulation of higher-order thinking through computer programs (e.g. 
          problem solving, analysis). Information Technology covers the support, administration, and design of 
          telecommunication and computer systems. Some jobs related to this field include system analysts, 
          software programmers, and database administrators. Specializing in IT means that you assume 
          responsibility for selecting software or hardware products appropriate for an organization, and to 
          integrate them accordingly to the needs of the organization and infrastructure; and to install, 
          customize, and maintain the applications for their users IT is responsible for a lot of business 
          operations and everyone's access to information. Information Technology provides a foundation for 
          our workforce, as it supports many business functions, from data management to communications and 
          operational efficiency.
        </p>
        <br><br>
        <h2>Information Systems</h2>
        <br>
        <p>Information systems (IS) is a broad term used to define the
          hardware, software, processes, and people that networks use to
          gather, process, and manage information. Information systems help
          transform data into knowledge that informs decision-making. And in
          business, this gleaning of insights is imperative for thoughtful analysis,
          process improvement, and being more data-driven.
          While information technology may be what facilitates certain
          business activities, the heartbeat of information systems comes from
          the people involved, whether those individuals are on the receiving
          end of information systems services (e.g. customers) or the decision-makers 
          actually leveraging those services. Information systems are
          designed to make people's lives easier and more convenient, and,
          when used effectively, they can be a game-changer in terms of
          growth and advancement in a particular profession, activity, industry,
          or life in general.
        </p>
        <br><br>
        <h2>Software Engineering</h2>
        <br>
        <p>Software engineering is the branch of computer science that deals with
          the design, development, testing, and maintenance of software
          applications. Software engineers apply engineering principles and
          knowledge of programming languages to build software solutions for end
          users. Software engineers create and maintain programs to address user
          needs. They typically work on teams to design, develop, test, and
          document applications. They also work with other stakeholders to
          determine user requirements and gather feedback for further
          improvements.
